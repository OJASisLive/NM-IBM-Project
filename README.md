## 🚀 Features

- **📈 Forecasting Model**  
  Predicts supply chain demand using linear regression and evaluates performance with RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.

- **💬 AI Chatbot**  
  Understands user intents like order tracking, demand queries, and product info using spaCy NLP.

- **📡 IoT Feed Simulation**  
  Emulates real-time sensor data such as stock level and delivery status.

- **⛓️ Blockchain Simulation**  
  Mimics a lightweight blockchain ledger for transaction transparency.

- **🔐 AES Security Framework**  
  Encrypts and decrypts sensitive data to ensure secure communication.
